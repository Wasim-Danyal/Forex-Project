Once backlog is selected for a sprint it goes through multiple points before it is finally complete.

*In progress -* User story has been selected and is in progress
*Testing -* If User story requires testing for example code, then it is moved here to be tested before being assigned "Done"
*Done -* This is the final point where user stories are assigned completion.
